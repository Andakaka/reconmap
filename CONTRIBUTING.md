# Reconmap

Contributors are more than welcome. Past contributions have helped Reconmap become one of the best penetration testing platforms available. These guidelines exist to make sure we collaborate on the most efficient way possible. Depending on what your contribution is you might want to speak to the development team before doing anything. The guys are generally available on the [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/reconmap/community) for the project.

Contributors can add themselves to the [credits](CREDITS) in the same pull requests that includes their changes or separately. If the contribution is not in the form of code we can add the contributor's name to the CREDITS file for them.

## Contributing guidelines

- If you are contributing with code, make sure you have fork the project, and create a pull requests that contains amongst other things a description of your changes.
- Keep your changes small. The smaller the changeset the more likely to be merged. This applies to code an documentation.
